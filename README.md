# Usage

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cddr/prime.git
cd prime
bundle install         # installs minitest
bundle exec rake test  # prints table and runs tests
```

# Objective

Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10
prime numbers.

The program must run from the command line and print one table to STDOUT.
The first row and column of the table should have the 10 primes, with each
cell containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and column.

# Notes

• Consider complexity. How fast does your code run? How does it scale?

• Consider cases where we want N primes.

• Do not use the Prime class from stdlib (write your own code).

• Write tests. Try to demonstrate TDD/BDD.

When you’re done

Put your code on GitHub or email us a zip/tarball.

Thanks!
